# Orbix360 Core Elements

"Elements" are A-Frame entities that can be placed in Orbix360 Scenes and have 
properties such as position, rotation, etc. that can be edited via the 
Orbix360 interface.  

An Element definition consists of 2 parts:

* A `schema.json` file that defines the properties 
that will be editable for the Element
* A `template.html` file that defines the A-Frame HTML for the Element, including 
where the custom properties defined in the schema are injected

## Core Elements

To understand how schemas and templates are defined and used, take a look at the 
Core Elements examples provided.
